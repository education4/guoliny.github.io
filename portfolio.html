    <h1>The ShepYang Team</h1>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="dexter">Dexter Shepherd | Programmer</a></h2>
      <p>Dexter Shepherd is the co-founder of ShepYang & Co. The lad brought his idea of creating an AI forward by the group. Fuelled by and obsession with artificial intelligence, dexter pushed the group forward to build his take on the AI. With his impeccable arduino IDE skills he built a prototype of his dream and from there a group was born, ShepYang.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="guolin">Guolin Yang | Programmer</a></h2>
      <p>WARNING: EGO....What can I say about Guolin Yang, other than he is, arguably, utter perfection. The asian seems to be incredibly confident in his skills and ploughs through any task given to him; though it may take a while (as seen in the develpoment of the ShepYang & Co website). However his optimistic attitude, eventually, got him going.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="morgan">Morgan Pile | Designer</a></h2>
      <p>Art boy is the artyist of the group with him taking gcse art. He is a renowned artist, with his pieces available on imgur - under the creativity section, of course. Following his short-lived success, Pilecan came back down to earth, back to reality - this hell hole of a place we live in. With his holy pens, pencils and rubbers, Morgan is the proud creator of the ShepYang logo the face of our small group.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="josh">Josh Hassett | Hardware Guy</a></h2>
      <p>Josh Hassett and food, predator and prey, egg and yolk. This kid has turned 16 but is still stuck in the body of 5 year old - with stubble. He is the hardware guy in the group who is in charge of putting together hardware and takes a key role in the development of it.</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="martha">Martha Whitehouse-Eagle | Designer</a></h2>
      <p>Martha is "useless, she hasnt done anything in the group...lol". yeh martha yeh. With that attitude youll be going nowhere. You were in charge of wrist bands...you had one f*@king job. Notice the past tense "were". this kid also does art gcse, when i say that i mean she sits in the corner with her paints trying to do god knows what and calls it art. pffffff feminists these days!!!</p>
    <br>
    <h2><a name="izi">Izi King | Programmer</a></h2>
      <p>Izi is new to STEM. She is a midget and tries being chinese though an asian is supposed to be good at maths, and by being in 4th set maths that is not the case, unlike this perfect chink. However she is too sexy to look at and thus i do not have any eyes. <3</p>
